Extend the code by adding new files into the project:
1. finance.h file should store the following signatures:
/*
print me my credit payments by months
*/
void printCreditRates(struct account acc, 
	double amount, int months);

void printDepositRates(struct account acc,
	double amount, int months);

/*
In a loop starting from month 1 till n should
apply negative rates to current account's money
*/	
void takeCredit(struct account acc, 
	double amount, int months);
/*
In a loop starting from month 1 till n should
apply positive rates to current account's money
*/	
void putDeposit(struct account acc, 
	double amount, int months);
	
2. finance_operations.cpp files one should place body code 
for finance.h file

3. in the main.cpp file use all the functions to display 
it's operations, for example:
account acc;
printCreditRates(acc, 10000, 12);
takeCredit(acc, 10000, 12);
